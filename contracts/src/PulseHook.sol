//  CONTRACT
// -----------------------------------------------

/// @title Priority Fee Pulse Hook
/// @notice Uniswap v4 hook that tracks a running (approximate) median of the
///         priority fee paid by swappers and penalizes swaps whose priority
///         fee is significantly above that median, discouraging aggressive
///         priority-fee bidding (e.g. sandwich/MEV-style behavior) via a
///         higher dynamic LP fee.
/// @dev To resist single-block / short-burst manipulation of the running
///      median, the fee decision is not based on the live, per-swap-updated
///      median directly. Instead, the live median is snapshotted once per
///      block into a rolling window (see SnapshotWindowLibrary), and the
///      fee is computed against the average of that window. The live
///      median itself is also gated by a tick checker (see
///      TickCheckerLibrary): a swap only feeds its priority fee into the
///      median if the pool's tick has moved far enough since the last
///      accepted update.
///
///      Read/compute logic lives in libraries; this contract is
///      orchestration only - it holds storage, implements the BaseHook
///      callbacks, and wires PoolManager data into the library calls.
