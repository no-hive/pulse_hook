/// @title TickCheckerLibrary
/// @notice Stateful library that gates running-median updates by price
///         movement, per pool.
/// @dev Rationale: without this gate, many swaps that barely move the
///      price (or don't move it at all, e.g. tiny/dust trades) could each
///      nudge the running median in the same direction. Requiring a
///      minimum tick displacement means the median only reacts to swaps
///      that actually pushed the pool to a new price level - not to
///      repeated pokes at essentially the same price, which is exactly the
///      kind of cheap, repeatable action an attacker would use to drag the
///      median toward a favorable value. The required displacement is not
///      a flat constant - it is scaled by the pool's current liquidity
///      depth in `requiredMovement`, because the same tick move means very
///      different things in a deep pool vs. a shallow one.
///
///      Operates directly on the caller's storage via a `storage` struct
///      reference (the same pattern OpenZeppelin uses for EnumerableSet /
///      Checkpoints).
